## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This FAQ challenge helped me familiarize myself with creating accordions from scratch. I know Bootstrap has an accordion component but I like trying to build these components myself. I used Javascript to dynamically get the max-height of a container by using its scrollHeight so that I can create a smooth transition when opening and closing the accordion. I enjoy completing projects with HTML, CSS and JS but maybe in the near future I will use frameworks or libraries.
